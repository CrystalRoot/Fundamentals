                <button class="question">Question #1: What attribute and value can you use to cause an anchor element to open the link in a new browser tab?</button>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Answer #1: You would use the "target" attribute with the value of "_blank" to open a link in a new browser tab. The "target" attribute specifies where to open the link. The default value is "_self," which opens the link in the current tab.</p>

            <div class="question-item">
                <button class="question">Question #2: How can you use the lang attribute if you have a webpage that uses more than one language? For example, let's say it has one section element where the contents are in French, and another section element where the contents are in Japanese. What can you do in this case?</button>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Lang is a global attribute, which means it can be used with all HTML elements. This means that you can add a lang attribute to elements of any level. We are taught initially to add it to the HTML element itself, thereby applying it to the entire document, but it can alternatively be added to smaller elements such as a header or paragraph or section. In this way, you can specify different language attributes to different pieces of the same document.</p>
                    <p>Example: <pre><code><section id="french" lang="fr">Lorem Ipsum</section></code></pre><br><pre><code></code><section id="japanese" lang="ja">Lorem Ipsum</section></code></pre></p>
